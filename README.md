# Sql-Queries-project


This SQL project dataset consists of multiple tables that capture various aspects of a DVD rental system. The tables include film, category, film category, film actor, actor, language, customer, address, city, country, payment, rental, store, inventory, and staff. The dataset provides a comprehensive set of data for analysis and insights. The project involves performing several analysis tasks using SQL queries.

The SQL project dataset offers an opportunity to analyze customer rental behavior, identify high-spending customers, track actor movie counts, and explore films in specific genres. These queries provide valuable insights into the rental business, customer preferences, and the performance of actors and films in the dataset.
